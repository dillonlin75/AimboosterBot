# AimboosterBot
Creating a simple image recognition bot for the game Aimbooster

run colorChecker.py to check color where your cursor is pointing at.

run regionChecker.py to check where the region of your game is located.
  it will save region as an image called aimimage.png. That's where you check to see if the image is the full region of your game or not
  
run Bot.py and have fun!
